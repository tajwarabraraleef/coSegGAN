### Dependencies
```
Python 3.6
Tensorflow: 2.0.0
Keras: 2.3.1
```

### Environment Setup

Recreate conda environment as follows:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Or if you are using Docker:
```
docker pull tazleef/tf2.0.0-cv-keras2.3.1-imgaug:latest
```

### Training

Due to privacy policy, we are unable to share our surgical dataset. However, we intend to release them soon once we get the approval. For now, we have included a few sample cases for reference. Alternatively, if you have your own data, format it in the same way and set the filepath and training parameters in `train.py`. 

To train the model, run `train.py`. 

This code can also be used for other segmentation tasks with domain variations.
